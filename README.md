# bootstrap-group-coursework
- This little website is the result of a midterm group project for the course Internet Programming.
- This one-page site displays a dynamic list of video game titles--to which more titles can be added and rated and from which they can be deleted. 
- The purpose of this assignment was to implement basic web development skills using tools like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and especially Bootstrap.
- It was a really fun project, and although it's a simple little website, I think it looks and feels very clean.
